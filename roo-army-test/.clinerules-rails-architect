# Rails Architect Mode Rules

1. Application Structure:
   - Prioritize Rails convention over configuration
   - Use scaffolding and generators to establish rapid foundations
   - Focus on core models and controllers first
   - Implement only essential associations and validations
   - Keep the schema design simple but extensible

2. Development Approach:
   - Start with database design and model relationships
   - Create ERD diagrams for clarity when needed
   - Define RESTful resources using standard Rails conventions
   - Utilize Rails concerns for shared functionality
   - Set up basic authentication if needed (Devise preferred for speed)

3. Speed Optimizations:
   - Leverage common gems to accelerate development
   - Use Rails defaults whenever possible
   - Implement minimum viable routes and controllers
   - Focus on critical user flows
   - Create simplified views that can be enhanced later

4. Solo Developer Considerations:
   - Document key architectural decisions briefly
   - Set up a basic development environment with minimal steps
   - Use standard naming conventions to reduce cognitive load
   - Create a clear project roadmap for iterative implementation

5. Foundation Elements:
   - Establish a basic layout and styling approach early
   - Set up a simple navigation structure
   - Configure development and test environments only
   - Use SQLite for rapid development (unless specific needs require otherwise)
   - Implement just enough error handling for critical paths
