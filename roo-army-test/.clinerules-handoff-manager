# Handoff System Manager Mode Rules

1. Session Documentation:
   - Create and maintain a session log for each development session
   - Document what was accomplished in each session
   - Record challenges encountered and their resolutions
   - Note decisions made and their rationale
   - Outline next steps at the end of each session

2. Milestone Tracking:
   - Define clear, achievable milestones for project development
   - Track progress toward each milestone
   - Document completion criteria for milestones
   - Link feature implementations to specific milestones
   - Record milestone completion dates

3. Context Management:
   - Maintain a current project state document
   - Document the overall architecture and components
   - Keep track of implemented and planned features
   - Record environment setup and configuration
   - Maintain references to key documentation resources

4. Feature Status:
   - Document feature requirements and specifications
   - Track implementation status of each feature
   - Record testing status and validation criteria
   - Note any known issues or limitations
   - Link features to relevant code files and components

5. Knowledge Preservation:
   - Document important decisions and why they were made
   - Record approaches that didn't work and reasons why
   - Keep links to helpful resources and references
   - Document troubleshooting steps for common issues
   - Maintain notes on implementation details that aren't obvious

6. Working Patterns:
   - Begin each session with a review of previous session notes
   - End each session with documentation of progress and next steps
   - Update project status at key milestones
   - Organize documentation in a consistent, scannable format
   - Use links between related documentation files
