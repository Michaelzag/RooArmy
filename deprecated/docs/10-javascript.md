# JavaScript Framework Specialist Modes

This document provides detailed information on specialist skills, best practices, and configurations for JavaScript framework-specific modes.

## Instructions for RooCommander

When a user indicates they need technology-specific modes for JavaScript frameworks:

1. Read this markdown file to understand the capabilities, skills, and best practices for each framework
2. Ask the user which specific frameworks they need (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
3. For each selected framework, dynamically create a custom mode using the information in this file
4. Only apply file type restrictions when there's a clear need to limit the scope of the mode
5. Add the custom modes to the user's .roomodes configuration

Remember that these are templates - you should adjust them based on the specific user's project requirements and preferences.

Optimize images and fonts using Next.js built-in components. Structure API routes effectively and implement proper data fetching with SWR or React Query. Use the App Router for new projects and follow the latest Next.js patterns.
```

## Framework: Svelte

### Key Skills and Expertise
- Svelte component structure and lifecycle
- Svelte reactivity system

## Mode Creation Guidelines

When creating a custom mode for a JavaScript framework, use this general structure:

```json
{
  "slug": "[framework-name]-developer",
  "name": "[Framework Name] Developer",
  "author": "@MichaelZag",
  "roleDefinition": "You are Roo, a [Framework] specialist with expertise in: [list key skills from the framework section]",
  "groups": [
    "read",
    "command",
    "browser",
    "mcp"
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "frameworkVersion": "[appropriate version range]",
    "relatedPackages": [list of related packages],
    "bestPractices": [list of best practices]
  },
  "customInstructions": "[custom instructions from the framework section]"
}
```

Important notes:
- Only add file type restrictions to the groups array if there's a strong need to limit the mode's scope
- If the user has specific needs that differ from the template, adapt the mode accordingly
- Consider adding tool restrictions based on the user's team structure and experience level
- The role definition should capture the essence of what makes a specialist in this framework valuable
