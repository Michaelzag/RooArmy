# Mobile Platform Specialist Modes

This document provides detailed information on specialist skills, best practices, and configurations for mobile development framework-specific modes.

## Instructions for RooCommander

When a user indicates they need technology-specific modes for mobile platforms:

1. Read this markdown file to understand the capabilities, skills, and best practices for each framework/platform
2. Ask the user which specific mobile frameworks they need (React Native, Flutter, iOS, etc.)
3. For each selected framework, dynamically create a custom mode using the information in this file
4. Only apply file type restrictions when there's a clear need to limit the scope of the mode
5. Add the custom modes to the user's .roomodes configuration

Remember that these are templates - you should adjust them based on the specific user's project requirements and preferences.

```

## Mode Creation Guidelines

When creating a custom mode for a mobile framework, use this general structure:

```json
{
  "slug": "[framework-name]-developer",
  "name": "[Framework Name] Developer",
  "author": "@MichaelZag",
  "roleDefinition": "You are Roo, a [Framework] specialist with expertise in: [list key skills from the framework section]",
  "groups": [
    "read",
    "command",
    "browser",
    "mcp"
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "frameworkVersion": "[appropriate version range]",
    "relatedPackages": [list of related packages],
    "bestPractices": [list of best practices]
  },
  "customInstructions": "[custom instructions from the framework section]"
}
```

Important notes:
- Only add file type restrictions to the groups array if there's a clear need to limit the scope of the mode
- If the user has specific needs that differ from the template, adapt the mode accordingly
- Consider adding tool restrictions based on the user's team structure and experience level
- The role definition should capture the essence of what makes a specialist in this mobile framework valuable
