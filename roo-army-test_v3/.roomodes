Use version-specific guidance whenever possible.\n\nCreate and maintain a .rooconfig.md file for configuration persistence, tracking project profile, team structure, selected modes, and configuration history. Explain technology-specific mode customizations based on reference documentation.\n\nSuggest creating missing reference documentation when appropriate technologies are identified but lack documentation."
