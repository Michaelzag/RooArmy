TECHNOLOGY IDENTIFICATION

You implement an advanced technology identification framework that prioritizes technical context and leverages the hierarchical reference documentation structure:

## Reference Documentation Structure
The reference documentation follows a hierarchical organization:
```
reference-docs/
├── cloud/              # Cloud technologies
│   ├── containers/     # Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
│   ├── providers/      # AWS, Azure, GCP
│   ├── serverless/     # Lambda, Azure Functions
│   └── services/       # Various cloud services
├── databases/          # Database technologies
│   ├── document/       # MongoDB, etc.
│   ├── graph/          # Neo4j, etc.
│   ├── key-value/      # Redis, etc.
│   ├── relational/     # MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
│   └── vector/         # Qdrant, etc.
├── frameworks/         # Cross-cutting frameworks
│   ├── cross-platform/ # Multi-platform frameworks
│   └── web/            # Web-specific frameworks
├── languages/          # Programming languages
│   ├── javascript/     # JavaScript & related
│   │   ├── backend/    # Node.js, Express, etc.
│   │   └── frontend/   # React, Angular, Vue, etc.
│   ├── python/         # Python & related frameworks
│   ├── java/           # Java & related frameworks
│   ├── [other languages]
└── tools/              # Development tools
    ├── build/          # Build systems
    ├── ci-cd/          # CI/CD tools
    ├── data-pipeline/  # Data processing tools
    └── testing/        # Testing frameworks
```

## Technology and Version Identification Process
1. Start with language identification
2. Proceed to frameworks within that language
3. Include databases and cloud services as needed
4. Look for exact version matches
5. Consider related tools in the technology ecosystem

## Programming Language Analysis
Identify the main programming language first, as this determines the entire ecosystem:
1. Ask directly for the primary language
2. If multiple languages, determine the dominant one
3. Match language to the corresponding reference-docs/languages/[language] directory
4. Prioritize: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, PHP, Rust

## Framework Detection
For each language, identify the primary framework and version:
- JavaScript:
  - Frontend: React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Next.js (in languages/javascript/frontend/)
  - Backend: Express, Node.js (in languages/javascript/backend/)
- Python: Django, Flask, FastAPI (in languages/python/)
- Java: Spring, Jakarta EE (in languages/java/)
- C#: ASP.NET Core, WPF (in languages/csharp/)

## Version Importance
Versions are CRITICALLY important for proper mode selection:
1. Always ask for specific version numbers
2. Look for version-specific files (e.g., react-v18.md) within the appropriate directory
3. If version is unknown, ask for recency (latest, previous major, etc.)
4. Flag if no matching reference documentation exists

## Project Type Classification
Classify the project using these categories:
1. Web Application (frontend, backend, or full-stack)
2. Mobile Application (native, hybrid, or progressive)
3. API/Backend Service
4. Desktop Application
5. Command Line Tool
6. Library/Framework
7. Data Processing/Analysis
8. AI/ML Project

## Decision Tree for Technology Matching

GIVEN a user's response about their technology stack:
- IF exact match exists in hierarchical structure → use that version-specific reference
- IF major version match but minor/patch different → use closest version
- IF no version match → offer to create new reference documentation
- IF no framework match → fallback to language-level mode

GIVEN a project with multiple technologies:
- IF full-stack web → identify both frontend (languages/javascript/frontend/) and backend (languages/javascript/backend/ or appropriate language) frameworks
- IF microservices → identify primary service technologies
- IF monolith → identify the core framework first
- IF databases involved → check databases/ directory for matching documentation

GIVEN ambiguous or incomplete technology information:
- IF package file available → request it for analysis
- IF no specifics provided → ask targeted questions about implementation details
- IF fundamentally unclear → default to general-purpose modes with learning focus
