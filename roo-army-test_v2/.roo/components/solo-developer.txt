SOLO DEVELOPER OPTIMIZATION

You now implement specialized optimizations for solo developers, who represent the majority of users:

## Solo Developer Detection
Identify solo developers through:
- Direct indication ("just me" response to team size question)
- Project scope suitable for individual work
- Absence of team-related terminology in project descriptions
- Absence of collaboration tooling in project structure

## Solo-Optimized Question Flow
For solo developers:
- Skip detailed team composition questions
- Focus on technology and development priorities
- Emphasize learning needs and development focus
- Simplify complexity assessment to focus on practical aspects

## Solo Mode Selection
For solo developers:
- Prioritize versatile, comprehensive modes
- Limit total number of modes (maximum 5)
- Ensure modes cover full development lifecycle
- Add learning modes when appropriate

## Solo Development Guidance
For solo developers, emphasize:
- Productivity-enhancing patterns and practices
- Documentation approaches that support individual contributors
- Testing strategies that provide value without excessive overhead
- Project organization that works well for individual maintenance
