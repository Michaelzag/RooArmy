# RooCommander 3.5 Enhancements

This document explains the RooCommander 3.5 enhancements that have been implemented in your system.

## Overview of Enhancements

The RooCommander 3.5 update introduces several key improvements:

1. **Context-Aware Assessment**: Enhanced project scanning to detect technologies and adapt the assessment flow
2. **Improved Complexity Assessment**: More intuitive complexity questions that map to the Cynefin framework
3. **Solo Developer Optimization**: Streamlined assessment flow for individual developers
4. **Wizard-Style Mode Customization**: Guided approach to reviewing and customizing generated modes
5. **Progressive Disclosure Pattern**: More relevant questions based on previous answers

## Implementation Files

The enhancements have been implemented in two main files:

1. `system-prompt-commander` - Enhanced system prompt with improved context detection and wizard guidance
2. `questions.json` - Revised question structure with improved complexity assessment and conditional paths

## Key Features

### Context-Aware Assessment

The system now performs intelligent project scanning by:

- Examining directory structure for common patterns
- Identifying package files for dependency analysis
- Looking for configuration files that indicate technologies
- Checking for handoff directories and documentation

This information is used to pre-fill answers and adapt questions, making the assessment more efficient.

### Improved Complexity Assessment

Instead of directly asking about Cynefin complexity domains, the system now asks more practical questions:

- "Which of these best describes your project?" (familiarity with patterns)
- "How clear is the solution path for this project?" (solution clarity)
- "How much iteration do you expect during development?" (iteration expectation)

These questions map to the Simple, Complicated, and Complex domains while being more accessible to users.

### Solo Developer Optimization

For solo developers (identified by "Just me" response to team size):

- Team-related questions are skipped
- A focused set of questions about individual development priorities is presented
- Mode recommendations are optimized for individual development (max 5 modes)

### Wizard-Style Mode Customization

After assessment, the system provides a guided approach to mode configuration:

1. Presents recommended modes with explanations
2. Offers customization options for selected modes
3. Guides through role definition, tool permissions, and custom instructions
4. Shows preview of changes before applying

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

Questions are presented based on context and previous answers:

- Existing vs. new project determines initial path
- Team size determines whether team questions are shown
- Project scan results influence technology questions
- Only relevant framework/version questions are shown

## Benefits

These enhancements provide several key benefits:

1. **Reduced Assessment Time**: Automatic scanning and context detection reduce unnecessary questions
2. **More Intuitive Experience**: Practical complexity questions that developers can relate to
3. **Tailored Experience**: Different paths for solo developers vs. teams
4. **Greater Transparency**: Guided mode customization makes configuration more accessible
5. **Better Mode Configuration**: More accurate mode selection based on comprehensive context

## Future Improvements

Future versions could further enhance these capabilities:

1. Deeper static analysis of code patterns
2. Integration with version control for contribution history
3. Expanded technology detection capabilities
4. Additional customization options for modes

## Compatibility

These enhancements are compatible with the existing RooCommander architecture and require no external code execution or JavaScript applications.
