# RooCommander 3.5 Enhancements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the next generation of RooCommander enhancements that build upon the existing Round 3 implementation. These improvements focus on creating a more intelligent, context-aware assessment process while introducing a guided, conversational flow similar to the "Wizard Mode" concept seen in community forks. The enhancements maintain the sophisticated complexity assessment that makes RooCommander powerful while making the experience more intuitive and accessible.

## Key Enhancement Areas

### 1. Context-Aware Assessment with Guided Flow

**Current Limitation:** The assessment process follows a rigid questionnaire format that doesn't adapt to project context, creating unnecessary friction, especially for solo developers.

**Enhancement:**
- Implement automatic project scanning to detect technologies, patterns, and existing code
- Use detected context to pre-fill or shortcut appropriate questions
- Present a "guided conversation" rather than a rigid questionnaire
- Maintain sophisticated complexity assessment in more approachable language
- Adapt assessment paths based on new vs. existing project detection

**Implementation:**
The LLM can directly analyze the project structure by:
- Scanning for README files and extracting project descriptions
- Identifying package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files
- Examining directory structure patterns (src/, app/, tests/)
- Checking for handoff directories and documentation
- Looking for configuration files that indicate technologies in use

Using these insights, the system can pre-fill answers and adjust questions accordingly, without requiring external code execution.

### 2. Enhanced Complexity Determination

**Current Limitation:** The Cynefin-based complexity assessment uses academic terminology that feels disconnected from practical development concerns.

**Enhancement:**
- Rephrase complexity questions in practical, concrete terms related to the project
- Use multiple indicators to triangulate complexity rather than a single question
- Apply conversational intelligence to detect complexity from project descriptions
- Provide technology-specific examples to illustrate complexity categories

**Implementation:**
For web development projects, ask more practical questions like:
- "Will you be following established patterns like a typical CRUD application, or exploring new interaction models?"
- "Is this similar to projects you've built before, or are you solving new problems?"
- "Do you expect to iterate significantly on the design, or is the solution path clear?"

Similar question sets can be developed for other technology domains, focusing on real-world considerations rather than academic complexity theory.

### 3. Solo Developer Focus

**Current Limitation:** Many questions assume team contexts that are irrelevant for individual developers, creating unnecessary cognitive load.

**Enhancement:**
- Default to solo developer assumptions for streamlined experience
- Detect potential team scenarios based on project size and structure
- Provide team configuration only when clearly relevant
- Build questions that recognize the solo-first nature of most projects

**Implementation:**
The LLM can analyze context clues to determine team size:
- Default to assuming a solo developer
- Look for mentions of "team," "we," or collaboration tools in project READMEs
- Consider project scope and complexity as potential indicators
- Only surface team-related questions when there are clear signals of a team context
- When in doubt, explicitly ask if the user is working alone or with a team, but make this optional

### 4. Streamlined Technology Identification

**Current Limitation:** All projects go through the same technology identification flow regardless of context, often asking questions that could be inferred.

**Enhancement:**
- Start with essential stack identification (language, framework, database)
- Use package analysis and project scanning to reduce question burden
- Adapt questions based on new vs. existing project context
- Present technology-specific follow-ups only when relevant

**Implementation:**
The LLM can:
- Scan dependency files to extract technologies and versions
- Analyze import statements in source files to identify frameworks
- Look for configuration files specific to certain technologies
- Confirm detected technologies: "I see you're using Flask with SQLAlchemy. Is this correct?"
- Skip irrelevant questions based on detected technology stack

### 5. Wizard-Inspired Guided Mode Creation

**Current Limitation:** After assessment, mode creation happens behind the scenes without clear user guidance or control.

**Enhancement:**
- Provide a step-by-step wizard for reviewing and customizing generated modes
- Guide users through naming, role definition, tool group selection
- Show previews of generated configuration before applying
- Offer explanation of each mode's purpose in the overall configuration

**Implementation:**
The LLM can implement a conversational wizard by:
- Presenting recommended modes: "Based on your project, I recommend these custom modes..."
- Offering customization options: "Would you like to customize any of these modes?"
- Guiding through specific elements: "Let's adjust the role definition for this mode. The current definition is..."
- Previewing changes: "Here's how your .roomodes file will look with these changes..."
- Confirming final setup: "I'll now create these modes for your project. Would you like to proceed?"

## Integration with Existing System

These enhancements build upon the existing RooCommander architecture while extending its capabilities:

1. **Component Architecture:** Maintain the modular component-based architecture but add new components for context detection and wizard-style guidance

2. **Configuration Persistence:** Preserve and strengthen the `.rooconfig.md` approach for tracking configuration history

3. **Reference Documentation:** Leverage the hierarchical reference documentation structure for providing technology-specific guidance

4. **Mode Selection Logic:** Enhance mode selection algorithms to better incorporate complexity assessment and solo context

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Context Detection
- Enhance the system prompt to include project scanning instructions
- Develop patterns for identifying technologies from file structure
- Create templates for extracting information from package files
- Build handoff analysis capabilities

### Phase 2: Assessment Flow Improvement
- Redesign question flow with conditional paths
- Rephrase complexity questions for clarity
- Create solo-developer optimized question set
- Implement progressive disclosure pattern

### Phase 3: Wizard-Style Guidance
- Develop step-by-step mode creation conversation flow
- Create configuration preview templates
- Design guided customization dialogue
- Build transition to implementation modes

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- Test with various project types and contexts
- Validate with solo vs. team scenarios
- Measure assessment completion rates
- Compare with previous version metrics

## Next Steps

1. Update system prompt to include project scanning capabilities
2. Develop prototype of revised question flow
3. Test rephrased complexity questions with users
4. Create initial wizard-style mode creation dialogue
