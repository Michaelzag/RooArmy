## Research Insights from Perplexity

For solo developers simulating professional perspectives, research suggests:

### Essential Roles
1. **Software Architect**: Overall system design and technology choices
2. **Full-Stack Developer**: Combined front-end and back-end development
3. **DevOps Engineer**: Deployment, infrastructure, and CI/CD
4. **QA Engineer**: Testing and validation
5. **UI/UX Designer**: User interface and experience design
6. **Security Engineer**: Security implementation and review

### Roles to Combine/Simplify
- Frontend + Backend → Full-Stack Developer
- SRE + DevOps → DevOps/Reliability Engineer
- Data Engineer + DBA → Data Specialist
- API Designer can be part of Architect or Full-Stack

### Missing Critical Roles
- **Product Manager**: Vision, feature prioritization, user needs
- **Technical Writer**: Documentation for users and developers

## Recommended Role Structure for AI Assistant

### Core Roles (Essential Set)

1. **Commander/Product Owner**
   - Equivalent to Requirements Engineer + Project Owner
   - Conducts project assessment and requirement gathering
   - Sets direction and priorities

2. **Solution Architect**
   - Designs overall system
   - Makes technology decisions
   - Creates architecture documentation

3. **Full-Stack Engineer**
   - Implements both frontend and backend
   - Practical consolidation for solo context
   - Can switch to specialized frontend/backend when needed

4. **DevOps/Reliability Engineer**
   - Handles deployment and infrastructure
   - Ensures system stability and monitoring
   - Combines operational concerns

5. **QA Engineer**
   - Ensures quality through testing
   - Verifies requirements are met
   - Essential perspective even for solo developers

6. **Technical Writer**
   - Documents code, APIs, and user guides
   - Creates comprehensive system snapshots
   - Preserves knowledge for future reference

### Specialized Roles (As Needed)

- **Security Engineer**: For security-critical projects
- **UI/UX Designer**: When focused on user experience
- **Database Specialist**: For data-intensive applications
- **Performance Engineer**: For optimization phases
- **Mobile Developer**: For mobile-specific projects

## Role Workflow Integration

The power of this system comes from how roles interact in the development workflow:

1. **Commander/Product Owner**: Defines requirements and project scope
2. **Solution Architect**: Creates system design based on requirements
3. **UI/UX Designer**: Designs user interfaces (when needed)
4. **Full-Stack Engineer**: Implements the design
5. **QA Engineer**: Tests the implementation
6. **Security Engineer**: Reviews for vulnerabilities
7. **DevOps Engineer**: Deploys the solution
8. **Technical Writer**: Documents the system

### Transition Triggers

Clear indicators for when to switch modes:
- Product Owner → Architect: When requirements are clear and design is needed
- Architect → Full-Stack: When design is complete and implementation begins
- Full-Stack → QA: When implementation is ready for testing
- QA → DevOps: When testing is complete and deployment preparation begins

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Refine the metadata structure** to include:
   - Development phases each role participates in
   - Clear transition triggers between roles
   - Role relationships and dependencies

2. **Update the assessment system** to:
   - Focus more on solo developer workflow
   - Include product management aspects
   - Balance comprehensive coverage with practical role count

3. **Create role-specific clinerules** with:
   - Workflow guidance for each role
   - Best practices specific to the role
   - Transition prompts to other roles
