# RooCommander Prompt Analysis Handoff - 2025-03-01

## Summary
Analyzed the RooCommander system prompt structure with its component-based architecture and "What-How-What" methodology. The prompt implements a sophisticated technology-first approach with hierarchical reference documentation, configuration persistence, and team-based mode selection logic. Integration opportunities with the handoff system were identified.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Add project discovery questions to enhance technology identification and team structure analysis
- **MEDIUM**: Integrate RooCommander with the handoff system for configuration persistence across sessions
- **LOW**: Expand hierarchical reference documentation with more detailed technology profiles

## Discoveries
- The component-based prompt architecture allows for modular maintenance and easier updates
- The "What-How-What" methodology prioritizes technology identification before team structure analysis
- Reference documentation follows a well-structured hierarchical organization
- Configuration persistence uses a standardized .rooconfig.md format to track project context

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: The prompt needs more detailed project discovery questions for technology identification
  **Solution**: Develop a set of targeted questions for key technology stacks and project types:
  ```
  // Example Project Discovery Questions
  const projectQuestions = [
    "What is the primary programming language used in your project?",
    "Which frameworks or libraries are you using? Please specify versions if known.",
    "Are you using any databases? If so, which ones and what versions?",
    "What deployment platforms or cloud services are you targeting?",
    "Can you share your package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files?"
  ];
  ```

- **Problem**: RooCommander and handoff system work independently without integration
  **Solution**: Create a bridge that leverages both systems, where RooCommander project profiles are stored in handoffs:
  ```
  // Integration Concept
  function createHandoffFromConfiguration(configPath) {
    const config = readConfigFile(configPath);
    return generateHandoffDocument(
      "project-configuration", 
      config.projectProfile,
      config.teamStructure,
      config.selectedModes,
      new Date()
    );
  }
  ```

- **Problem**: Reference documentation needs better versioning for technology evolution
  **Solution**: Implement a version comparison system to suggest appropriate documentation:
  ```
  function findBestVersionMatch(technology, version, docsDirectory) {
    const availableVersions = getAvailableVersions(technology, docsDirectory);
    return semanticVersionMatch(version, availableVersions);
  }
  ```

## Work in Progress
- RooCommander prompt analysis: 100%
- Integration with handoff system: 20%
- Additional discovery questions development: 40%
- Reference documentation expansion: 15%

## Deviations
- The original script was focused on file operations rather than component assembly; shifted to a comprehensive integrated approach
- Added direct system prompt component assembly within Node.js script instead of relying on external bash script
- Modified regex patterns in .roomodes to remove the ask_followup_question tool which was causing issues
