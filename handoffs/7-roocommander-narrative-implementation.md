# Narrative-Driven Implementation Handoff - 2025-03-02

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive narrative-driven, solo-first approach for RooCommander by refactoring system components and removing team-focused elements. Fixed architectural issues that prevented the new conversational approach from working properly and established explicit instructions for one-by-one question presentation.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Fix remaining test case issues causing unexpected question grouping and team size inquiries
- **HIGH**: Add pre-conversation to gather initial project information before structured assessment
- **MEDIUM**: Implement slower pacing with more frequent user confirmations
- **MEDIUM**: Reintegrate requirements engineer expertise area
- **MEDIUM**: Make sure technology selections are written into the mode prompts. Explore additional methodologies for this
- **LOW**: Explore different LLM's for differnet modes

## Discoveries
- The issue with questions about team size persisting was due to multiple overlapping components rather than just question files
- Two parallel system architectures existed: component-based assembly and monolithic system prompt
- The fallback to team/solo questions in the assembly process was causing inconsistent behavior
- `00-index.json` was unnecessarily constraining the LLM's ability to generate contextually appropriate modes

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Team structure questions persisted despite updating question components
  **Solution**: Completely removed the team-structure.txt component and modified related components:
  ```
  mv roo-commander/.roo/components/team-structure.txt roo-commander/.roo/components/team-structure.txt.deprecated
  ```

- **Problem**: Configuration template still contained team structure sections
  **Solution**: Redesigned configuration template in configuration-persistence.txt:
  ```
  # Project Configuration

  ## Project Profile
  - **Name**: [project_name]
  - **Type**: [project_type]
  - **Primary Language**: [language]
  - **Framework**: [framework] v[version]
  ...

  ## Development Approach
  - **Quality/Speed Balance**: [balance]
  - **Experience Level**: [level]
  - **Development Focus**: [focus_areas]
  ```

- **Problem**: Questions were being grouped instead of presented one at a time
  **Solution**: Added explicit directives in mode-selection.txt:
  ```
  - PRESENT questions ONE AT A TIME, never grouped together
  ```

- **Problem**: Assembly process had fallbacks to team/solo question structure
  **Solution**: Updated scripts/setup-test.js to remove fallbacks and provide clear error messages:
  ```javascript
  // Load phase3 development experience (solo-first unified approach)
  const phase3File = path.join(componentsDir, 'phase3_development_experience.json');
  if (fs.existsSync(phase3File)) {
    const phase3Data = loadJSON(phase3File);
    if (phase3Data) {
      questions.assessment.phase3_development_experience = phase3Data;
    }
  } else {
    console.error('- Critical component missing: phase3_development_experience.json not found');
    // Do not fall back to the deprecated team/solo approach
    ...
  }
  ```

## Work in Progress
- Narrative-driven solo-first implementation: 90%
- Dynamic mode generation without rigid categorization: 75%
- Conversational flow enhancement: 50%
- Requirements engineer reintegration: 0%

## Deviations
- Completely deprecated 00-index.json instead of modifying it, to remove artificial constraints on LLM mode generation
- Changed terminology from "modes" to "expertise areas" for narrative consistency
- Redesigned configuration format to completely eliminate team structure concepts
- Replaced team-based mode limits with cognitive-load based guidelines (5-7 expertise areas)
