# RooCommander Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating the RooCommander system with the handoff management system to create a more powerful context management solution. By combining RooCommander's technology detection and mode configuration capabilities with the handoff system's persistence and session restoration features, we can create a more comprehensive solution for managing development context.

## Integration Points

### 1. Configuration Persistence Bridge

Create a bidirectional bridge between RooCommander's `.rooconfig.md` and the handoff system:

- When a project is configured with RooCommander, store the configuration in a handoff
- When resuming a session, use handoff information to restore RooCommander context
- Track configuration changes over time through sequential handoffs

### 2. Enhanced Project Discovery Questions

Expand the RooCommander's project discovery capabilities with more detailed questions:

#### Primary Technology Stack
- What is the primary programming language used in your project?
- Which frameworks or libraries are you using? (Please include version numbers if known)
- What package manager do you use? (npm, yarn, pip, poetry, etc.)
- Do you use TypeScript, Flow, or other type systems?
- Are you building a frontend, backend, or full-stack application?

#### Frontend Specific
- Which UI framework do you use? (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Do you use a meta-framework? (Next.js, Nuxt, Remix, etc.)
- Which styling approach do you use? (CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, etc.)
- What state management solution do you implement? (Redux, Mobx, Zustand, Context API, etc.)
- Do you use any component libraries? (Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, etc.)

#### Backend Specific
- Which API style do you use? (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)
- Which backend framework do you use? (Express, Django, FastAPI, Rails, etc.)
- What authentication mechanism do you implement? (JWT, OAuth, custom, etc.)
- How do you handle validation? (Zod, Joi, custom validators, etc.)
- Do you use any specific architecture patterns? (MVC, Clean Architecture, etc.)

#### Database & Storage
- Which databases do you use? (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)
- Do you use any ORM or query builders? (Prisma, Sequelize, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- How do you handle migrations?
- Do you use any specific caching strategies or technologies?
- Do you use any file storage services? (S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.)

#### DevOps & Deployment
- Where is your application deployed? (AWS, Azure, GCP, Vercel, etc.)
- Do you use containerization? (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- What is your CI/CD setup? (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.)
- How do you handle environment variables and secrets?
- Do you implement Infrastructure as Code? (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)

#### Testing & Quality
- What testing frameworks do you use? (Jest, pytest, RSpec, etc.)
- Do you practice TDD or BDD?
- What is your approach to end-to-end testing?
- How do you manage code quality? (ESLint, Prettier, Black, etc.)
- Do you use any static analysis tools?

#### Team Structure
- How many developers work on this project?
- What specialized roles exist on your team? (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, etc.)
- What is the experience level of your team?
- How do you divide responsibilities among team members?
- What is your development workflow? (Git flow, GitHub flow, etc.)

### 3. Session Contextualization

Leverage both systems to maintain rich context across work sessions:

- Store technical decisions and their rationale in handoffs
- Use RooCommander to identify technology-specific modes based on project context
- Create milestone summaries that include technology stack evolution

### 4. Reference Documentation Enhancement

Improve the reference documentation structure to support both systems:

- Include "Common Issues" sections in technology reference docs that can be referenced in handoffs
- Add "Migration Patterns" for technology version changes
- Develop "Integration Patterns" for connecting different technology stacks

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
- Modify RooCommander to generate handoff documents when configuring projects
- Update handoff templates to include technology stack information
- Create a basic bridge between .rooconfig.md and handoff documents

### Phase 2: Enhanced Question System
- Implement the expanded question set for better project discovery
- Create conditional question paths based on initial technology identification
- Develop question prioritization based on project type

### Phase 3: Full Context Management
- Build a unified context model that leverages both systems
- Create visualization tools for project evolution over time
- Implement intelligent suggestions based on historical handoffs and technical context

## Next Steps

1. Create a prototype integration script that can read `.rooconfig.md` and generate a handoff
2. Develop a question flow module for the RooCommander system prompt
3. Test the integration with several project types to validate the approach
4. Refine the question set based on testing results
