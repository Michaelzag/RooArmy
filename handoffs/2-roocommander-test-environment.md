# RooCommander Test Environment Handoff - 2025-03-01

## Summary
Implemented a component-based system prompt architecture for RooCommander with modular files in `.roo/components/`. Created scripts to generate test environments with proper file structure and dependencies. Organized project files into system files and documentation.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Test the RooCommander in the test environment to verify "What-How-What" methodology
- **MEDIUM**: Consider expanding reference documentation in hierarchical structure
- **LOW**: Add more component files for additional functionality

## Discoveries
- Component-based architecture allows easier maintenance of system prompt sections
- Git Bash commands differ from standard Node.js file operations, requiring adaptations in setup scripts
- Reference documentation requires both hierarchical (new) and flat (legacy) structures

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Symbolic links not working properly in Windows environment
  **Solution**: Used direct file copying instead of symbolic links for test environment setup
  
- **Problem**: System prompt assembly requires consistent section ordering
  **Solution**: Created `assemble-components.sh` script with explicit component order and embedded it in setup-test.js

- **Problem**: Rules for the commander mode weren't defined in a portable way
  **Solution**: Created `.clinerules-commander` file in source directory to be copied rather than generated

## Work in Progress
- Test environment configuration: 100%
- Component-based architecture: 100%
- Reference documentation integration: 80%
- Mode rule definitions: 100%

## Deviations
- Changed from complex to simpler test environment script after feedback
- Removed auto-generation of configuration files to ensure clean slate for testing
- Moved scripts to dedicated directory for better organization
