# RooCommander Assessment Methodology Handoff - 3/1/2025

## Summary
Restructured the RooCommander assessment framework to implement the "What-How-What" methodology, focusing on technology identification before team structure. Updated question flow, mode definition, and created configuration persistence template to align with the new component-based system prompt architecture.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Integrate new questions-v2.json with the RooCommander system prompt components
- **MEDIUM**: Create unit tests to validate the phase transitions in the questions flow
- **LOW**: Add additional technology versions to the reference documentation hierarchy

## Discoveries
- The phase-based question structure enables a more natural flow from technology to team structure 
- Explicit version-specific questions enable direct mapping to reference documentation
- Configuration persistence through `.rooconfig.md` provides a clear history of project configuration

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: The original questions.json didn't enforce a technology-first approach
  **Solution**: Restructured into distinct phases with explicit transitions and required fields
  ```json
  "phase_transitions": {
    "phase1_to_phase2": {
      "required_fields": ["primary_language", "project_type"],
      "transition_message": "Now that we understand your technology stack, let's discuss your team structure."
    }
  }
  ```

- **Problem**: Reference documentation matching was implicit rather than explicit
  **Solution**: Added direct reference doc path mapping in question definitions
  ```json
  "reference_doc_path": "languages/javascript/frontend/react/react-v{value}.md"
  ```

## Work in Progress
- Integration with ask_perplexity for reference documentation creation: 20%
- Expansion of technology version options in questions: 70% 
- Unit tests for phase transitions: 0%

## Deviations
- Changed from a flat question structure to a phase-based structure to enforce methodology sequence
- Added metadata to commander.json to make methodology and reference docs location explicit
- Enhanced file access permissions to include `.rooconfig.md` for configuration persistence
