# RooCommander Solo-First Approach Handoff - 3/1/2025

## Summary
Implemented RooCommander 3.5 with a component-based architecture and solo-first approach. Key improvements include dynamic technology selection from reference docs, removal of team size questions, standardized mode limits (5-7 base + 3 for handoff), and wizard-style mode customization.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Test the updated setup-test.js script with a fresh install to validate component assembly
- **MEDIUM**: Ensure backward compatibility with existing installations that may still use the team_size question
- **LOW**: Add sample reference documentation files in the hierarchical structure to test dynamic loading

## Discoveries
- The component-based approach significantly improves maintainability by keeping file sizes under 500 lines
- Dynamic technology selection from reference-docs/ makes adding new frameworks/versions much easier
- Solo-first approach reduces unnecessary questions, making the wizard more efficient

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Hard-coded technology options in phase1_technology.json limited extensibility
  **Solution**: Implemented dynamic_select questions that load options from reference documentation
  ```json
  "type": "dynamic_select",
  "source": "languages",
  "options_template": [
    {"value": "{language_id}", "label": "{language_name}"}
  ],
  "fallback_options": [...]
  ```

- **Problem**: Team size question created unnecessary branching paths
  **Solution**: Removed team_size question and unified the experience flow for all users
  ```json
  // Removed from phase2_complexity.json:
  {
    "id": "team_size",
    "question": "How many people are on your development team?",
    "type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": [...]
  }
  ```

- **Problem**: Setup script needed updates to handle component-based questions.json
  **Solution**: Enhanced setup-test.js to assemble both system prompt and questions.json
  ```javascript
  // Added function to assemble questions.json from components
  function assembleQuestions(componentsDir, outputFile) {
    console.log('- Assembling questions.json from components...');
    // Component loading and assembly logic
  }
  ```

## Work in Progress
- Dynamic technology selection system: 90%
- Solo-first implementation: 100%
- Component-based architecture: 100%
- Setup script enhancements: 100%

## Deviations
- Changed from separate team/solo paths to a unified experience that defaults to solo development
- Replaced hard-coded technology options with dynamic loading from reference documentation structure
- Standardized mode limits instead of varying them by team size
