# RooCommander Separation Handoff - 2025-02-28

## Summary
Separated the RooCommander system from the custom modes pool to create a cleaner architecture. Reorganized all custom modes into functional categories with individual JSON files, and isolated the RooCommander configuration system into its own directory with dedicated tooling.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Update roo-commander to use the new folder organizations
- **MEDIUM**: Create a 99-* json file for adding community provided modes
- **LOW**: Update the RooCommander generator.js to correctly load and process modes from multiple JSON files in the custom-modes-pool directory

## Discoveries
- The Commander role was incorrectly defined as a Product Owner rather than a configuration consultant
- Grouping modes by functional type in separate files is more maintainable than a single monolithic JSON file
- The assessment system's mode scoring logic needed updating to match the new categorized mode structure

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Mixing the RooCommander system with the custom modes pool created confusion about their different purposes
  **Solution**: Created separate directories and systems - custom-modes-pool/ for the mode repository and roo-commander/ for the assessment system
  ```
  - custom-modes-pool/ - Contains all available modes by category
  - roo-commander/ - Contains the commander system and assessment logic
  ```

- **Problem**: The old questions.json file had hardcoded mode impacts that didn't match our new mode slugs
  **Solution**: Updated the mode impact calculations to reference the correct slugs in the categorized mode structure
  ```json
  "mode_impacts": {
    "microservices": ["architect+3", "devops+2"],
    "serverless": ["architect+3", "cloud+3"],
    "event_driven": ["architect+3", "backend+1"]
  }
  ```

## Work in Progress
- RooCommander assessment process refinement: 85%
- Custom modes categorization: 100%
- generator.js utility development: 90%
- Integration between RooCommander and custom-modes-pool: 80%

## Deviations
- Changed from a single modes.json file to multiple category-based files for better organization and maintainability
- Modified the Commander role definition to correctly focus on configuration assistance rather than product ownership
- Switched to using directory-based organization for both the modes pool and the commander system to support future expansion
