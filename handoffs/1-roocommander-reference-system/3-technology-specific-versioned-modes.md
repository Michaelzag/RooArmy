# Technology-Specific Versioned Modes Handoff - 2/28/2025

## Summary
Implemented version-specific reference documentation for technology-specific custom modes. Created individual reference files for various framework versions (React 17/18, Angular 16, Vue 3, Django 4.2, etc.) with detailed version-specific features, skills, and best practices. Modified the index structure to support versioned templates.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Test the versioned mode generation with RooCommander by having it create modes for specific technology versions
- **MEDIUM**: Expand version coverage to include additional technologies like Node.js, Swift, Kotlin
- **LOW**: Create a documentation guide explaining how to add new versions to the reference system

## Discoveries
- Versioning is critical for accurate technical guidance, as framework versions (like React 17 vs 18) have significantly different features and best practices
- A flat file structure with version numbers in filenames (e.g., react-v18.md) is more maintainable than nested directories
- Including package version numbers in the reference files helps ensure proper dependency compatibility

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: How to structure version-specific documentation without creating an overly complex directory structure
  **Solution**: Used a flat file structure in reference-docs/ with clear version indicators in filenames (e.g., react-v17.md, react-v18.md)

- **Problem**: How to integrate version references into the existing index structure
  **Solution**: Added a versionedTemplates array to each technology category:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "javascript",
    "name": "JavaScript Frameworks",
    "file": "10-javascript.json",
    "markdownTemplate": "10-javascript.md",
    "referenceDirectory": "reference-docs",
    "versionedTemplates": [
      "react-v17.md",
      "react-v18.md",
      "angular-v16.md",
      "vue-v3.md"
    ],
    "description": "Technology-specific modes for popular JavaScript frameworks"
  }
  ```

## Work in Progress
- Technology reference files: 100%
- Index structure updates: 100% 
- Test with RooCommander: 0%
- Documentation for adding new versions: 0%

## Deviations
- Changed from combined markdown files to individual version-specific files to make updates easier and more maintainable
- Added "Version-Specific Features" section to each reference file to highlight the unique capabilities of each framework version
