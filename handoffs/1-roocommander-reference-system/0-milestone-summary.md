# RooCommander Reference System Milestone Summary

## Date
March 1, 2025

## Changes
- Created comprehensive reference documentation schema for technology-specific guidance
- Implemented version-specific reference documentation for 55+ technology versions
- Reorganized reference docs into hierarchical structure (languages/javascript/frontend/react/)
- Developed custom system prompt for RooCommander using modular component architecture
- Implemented "What-How-What" assessment methodology in RooCommander
- Created configuration persistence system with .rooconfig.md
- Built component-based architecture for maintainable system prompts

## Decisions
- **Hierarchical Documentation Structure**: Changed from flat file structure to hierarchical organization for better navigation and scaling
- **Modular System Prompt Design**: Used component files for maintainable system prompt management
- **Technology-First Assessment**: Implemented "What-How-What" approach that prioritizes technology stack before team structure
- **Reference Schema Format**: Standardized reference documentation with consistent sections across all technologies
- **Configuration Format**: Used human-readable Markdown for configuration persistence
- **Directory-Based Technology Mapping**: Mapped technology paths based on type (language, framework, database)
- **Version-Specific Mode Selection**: Prioritized exact version matches for precise guidance

## Discoveries
- Version-specific documentation is critical for accurate technical guidance
- Hierarchical organization significantly improves reference navigation and management
- Component-based approach to system prompts enables easier maintenance
- Technology-first assessment produces more relevant mode recommendations
- Reference documentation quality directly impacts mode customization effectiveness
- Standardized schema improves consistency across technology documentation
- Configuration persistence enables evolving mode setups as projects mature

## Current State
The RooCommander system now has a comprehensive reference documentation system with hierarchical organization and a modular custom system prompt. The system uses the "What-How-What" methodology to assess project needs, starting with technology identification before addressing team structure. Reference documentation is organized in a structured directory hierarchy with categorized paths for different technology types. The custom system prompt is implemented with modular components for easier maintenance and updates.

Next steps include testing the system with real user interactions, creating validation tools for reference documentation, and expanding reference coverage to additional technologies. The foundation is now in place for a sophisticated, technology-specific mode recommendation system that leverages detailed version-specific guidance.
