# Framework Documentation Updates Handoff - 2/28/2025

## Summary
Updated the framework reference documentation to reflect the latest versions as of February 2025. Created new reference documents for major frameworks including Angular v19, Next.js v15, Vue.js v3.5, Django v5.1, and TensorFlow v2.18. Added documentation for previously uncovered popular frameworks Flask, Express.js, and PyTorch to improve framework coverage.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Review the new documentation files for technical accuracy and completeness
- **MEDIUM**: Update 00-index.json to include the new framework versions in the versionedTemplates array
- **LOW**: Consider expanding documentation to cover additional popular libraries like Nuxt.js, Pyramid, and NumPy

## Discoveries
- Most major frameworks have had significant version updates since our last documentation
- Angular had the most significant version jump from v16 to v19.1.5
- FastAPI's changes between v0.100 and v0.115.8 were mostly incremental, not warranting a new document
- There's increased convergence on async/await patterns across both Python and JavaScript frameworks

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Determining when version changes warrant a new document vs. updating existing one
  **Solution**: Analyzed the significance of changes between versions; created new files for major version changes with substantial new features, updated existing files for incremental changes
  
- **Problem**: Ensuring consistency across framework documentation
  **Solution**: Followed the established schema in 00-schema.md for all new documents, maintaining consistent sections and detail level

## Work in Progress
- Framework documentation updates: 100%
- Testing of new documentation with RooCommander: 0%
- Integration of new versions into the index structure: 0%

## Deviations
- Initially planned to update only existing frameworks, but added Flask, Express.js, and PyTorch documentation based on popularity assessment
- Kept FastAPI documentation as a single file despite version changes, as differences were incremental
