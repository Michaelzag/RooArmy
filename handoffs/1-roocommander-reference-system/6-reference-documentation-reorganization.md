# Reference Documentation Reorganization Handoff - 2025-03-01

## Summary
Reorganized the reference documentation for all technology modes from a flat structure to a hierarchical tree structure organized by technology type. This improves navigation, makes relationships between technologies clearer, and provides a more maintainable organization as new documentation is added.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: None
- **MEDIUM**: Update any scripts or tools that relied on the previous flat file structure to work with the new hierarchical structure
- **LOW**: Consider creating a documentation index or README in each technology subfolder to explain the contained documentation

## Discoveries
- Several redundant or duplicate documentation files existed for the same technology version (e.g., multiple React v19 files)
- The Kotlin Multiplatform files with RC version suffixes required special regex pattern handling for proper categorization

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Initial version of the reorganization script missed the Kotlin Multiplatform RC version files
  **Solution**: Updated the regex pattern to properly handle version suffixes like "-RC" in filenames
  ```python
  # Fixed pattern:
  (r"kotlin-multiplatform-v([\d\.]+(-RC)?)\.md", "languages/kotlin/kotlin-multiplatform/"),
  # Instead of:
  (r"kotlin-multiplatform-v([\d\.]+)\.md", "languages/kotlin/kotlin-multiplatform/"),
  ```

- **Problem**: Needed a way to execute the reorganization while preserving the original files
  **Solution**: Created a separate target directory (reference-docs-new) and copied files to their appropriate locations, keeping the original files intact in reference-docs-old

## Work in Progress
- File reorganization: 100% (All 78 documentation files successfully reorganized)
- Reference structure definition: 100% (Complete structure defined in reference-docs-structure.md)

## Deviations
- Changed from having separate version folders (e.g., /react/react-v17/) to placing all version files directly in the technology folder (e.g., /react/react-v17.md) for easier version comparison
