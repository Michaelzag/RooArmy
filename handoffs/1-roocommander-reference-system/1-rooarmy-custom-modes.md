# RooArmy Custom Modes Handoff - 2025-02-28

## Summary
Developed the RooArmy system for intelligent custom mode configuration in Roo. Created a structured approach with RooCommander assessment logic, professional role modes, and testing infrastructure. Fixed syntax issues with file restrictions in tool groups and expanded the mode definitions to align with real software engineering roles.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Improve the syntax for file restrictions in .roomodes files to use the correct format: `["edit", { "fileRegex": "pattern", "description": "text" }]`
- **MEDIUM**: Expand professional role definitions beyond simplified task-based modes to match real software engineering roles
- **LOW**: Create testing infrastructure in roo-army-test directory to verify mode configurations

## Discoveries
- The "ask_followup_question" entry in groups array causes syntax errors as it's a tool, not a valid tool group
- More intuitive, task-focused workflow is better than academic role divisions
- Tool groups must follow specific format for file restrictions to avoid syntax errors

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: The .roomodes file syntax was incorrect, causing errors with the "ask_followup_question" entry
  **Solution**: Removed invalid entry and updated to properly formatted tool group restrictions with JSON objects
  ```json
  "groups": [
    "read",
    ["edit", {
      "fileRegex": "\\.(roomodes|clinerules-.*|md)$",
      "description": "Mode configuration files and documentation"
    }],
    "command"
  ]
  ```

- **Problem**: Generic, oversimplified modes didn't match real software engineering roles
  **Solution**: Created enhanced professional role definitions in enhanced-modes.json with detailed metadata, complementary modes, and switching patterns
  ```json
  {
    "slug": "sre",
    "name": "Site Reliability Engineer",
    "roleDefinition": "You are Roo, a Site Reliability Engineer focusing on system stability, performance, and scalability...",
    "groups": [
      "read",
      ["edit", { "fileRegex": "\\.(yml|yaml|json|tf|toml|Dockerfile|sh|conf|ini)$" }],
      "command",
      "mcp"
    ],
    "metadata": {
      "category": "operations",
      "complementary_modes": ["devops", "security", "debug"]
    }
  }
  ```

## Work in Progress
- RooCommander UI/UX improvements: 75%
- Professional role expansion for specialized domains: 50%
- Integration with existing project assessment tools: 25%

## Deviations
- Changed from simple task-based modes (plan, build, test) to professional engineering roles (architect, engineer, SRE) to better align with real-world software teams
- Modified test directory structure to use JSON files instead of hardcoded configurations for better maintainability
