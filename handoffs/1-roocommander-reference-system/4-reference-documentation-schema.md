# Reference Documentation Schema Handoff - 2/28/2025

## Summary
Created a comprehensive schema for technology reference documentation that enables consistent, version-specific technical guidance. Implemented the schema across all reference files and enhanced existing documentation with version-specific differences. Updated the index structure to accommodate versioned templates and created additional reference files for important technology versions.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Integrate schema validation into the RooCommander workflow to ensure new reference docs follow the standard
- **MEDIUM**: Expand schema to include guidance for cross-technology integration points (e.g., React with TypeScript)
- **LOW**: Update all of the reference-docs to comply with new schema generation.

## Discoveries
- LLM-generated documentation benefits greatly from highly structured technical guidance
- Version-specific differences are crucial for accurate developer guidance
- Including exact version numbers for dependencies significantly improves compatibility guidance
- Different technologies require slightly different section emphases (e.g., mobile platforms need more deployment guidance)

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Ensuring consistency across reference documentation for different technologies
  **Solution**: Created detailed schema document with required sections, format rules, and validation checklist

- **Problem**: Providing sufficient technical depth without overwhelming breadth
  **Solution**: Standardized section structure with focused areas for version-specific features, skills, and best practices

- **Problem**: Helping users create high-quality reference documentation
  **Solution**: Provided explicit examples and a validation checklist in the schema document

## Work in Progress
- Reference schema document: 100%
- Schema implementation across existing docs: 100%
- Schema validation automation: 0%
- Documentation creation tool: 0%

## Deviations
- Added "Differences From Previous Version" section to reference schema, which wasn't initially planned but proved valuable for migration guidance
- Made some sections optional (with explanation) to accommodate technologies where they don't apply
- Enhanced the validation checklist to ensure quality and consistency
