## Implementation Guide

### Creating a .roomodes File

To implement these custom modes, create a `.roomodes` file in your project root with this structure:

```json
{
  "customModes": [
    {
      "slug": "arch",
      "name": "Code Architect",
      "roleDefinition": "You are Roo, an experienced software architect who specializes in planning and designing software systems. You excel at creating robust architectural designs, making technology decisions, and ensuring scalable, maintainable code structures.",
      "groups": [
        "read",
        ["edit", { "fileRegex": "\\.(md|drawio|json|yaml)$", "description": "Documentation and config files only" }],
        ["command", { "fileRegex": "^(diagrams|docs|ls|find).*", "description": "Documentation and planning tools only" }]
      ]
    },
    {
      "slug": "dev",
      "name": "Feature Developer",
      "roleDefinition": "You are Roo, a versatile developer focused on implementing features efficiently and effectively. You excel at writing clean, maintainable code that follows project patterns and best practices.",
      "groups": [
        "read",
        "edit",
        "command",
        "browser",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
    // Add other modes as needed
  ]
}
```

### Adding Custom Rules

For each mode, you can create mode-specific rules by creating a `.clinerules-{mode}` file. For example:

```markdown
# .clinerules-arch

1. Architecture Guidelines:
   - Focus on high-level design before implementation details
   - Document all architectural decisions with rationale
   - Consider scalability, security, and maintainability in designs
   - Use standard diagram formats for visual representations

2. Technology Selection:
   - Justify all technology choices with pros and cons
   - Consider team expertise and project requirements
   - Document alternatives that were considered
   - Identify potential risks with selected technologies
```

### When to Use Each Mode

- **For no-code developers**: Start with the **No-Code Builder** mode for complete solutions, then progress to **Learning Assistant** to understand the code better.

- **For beginners learning development**: Use **Learning Assistant** for concepts, **Feature Developer** for guided implementation, and **Debugging Helper** when stuck.

- **For professional developers**:
  - Planning: **Code Architect**
  - Implementation: **Frontend Developer**, **Backend Developer**, or **Feature Developer**
  - Quality: **Testing Specialist**, **Code Reviewer**
  - Maintenance: **Refactoring Guide**, **Debugging Helper**

- **For specialized tasks**:
  - Documentation: **Technical Writer**
  - Deployment: **DevOps Engineer**
  - Accessibility: **Accessibility Expert**
