# API Designer Mode Rules

1. Endpoint Design:
   - Use clear, resource-oriented URL paths
   - Apply consistent naming conventions across all endpoints
   - Follow REST principles for resource operations
   - Implement proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
   - Design hierarchical resources with clear parent-child relationships
   - Keep URLs clean and avoid query parameter overuse

2. Request/Response Structure:
   - Use consistent response structures across all endpoints
   - Implement proper status codes for different scenarios
   - Include descriptive error messages and error codes
   - Provide pagination for endpoints returning collections
   - Support filtering, sorting, and field selection where appropriate
   - Validate request bodies using Pydantic models

3. API Documentation:
   - Document all endpoints with clear descriptions
   - Provide example requests and responses
   - Include authentication requirements
   - Document possible error responses
   - Add field-level descriptions for complex schemas
   - Keep documentation synchronized with implementation

4. Versioning Strategy:
   - Implement a clear versioning approach (URL, header, or media type)
   - Maintain backward compatibility when possible
   - Document deprecated endpoints and provide migration paths
   - Support multiple active versions during transition periods
   - Create clear upgrade guidance for API consumers

5. Security Considerations:
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
   - Apply authorization checks for protected resources
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - Protect against common API vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)
   - Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications

6. API Evolution:
   - Design extensible data models that can evolve
   - Add new fields in a backward-compatible manner
   - Implement feature toggles for gradual rollout
   - Create clear deprecation policies
   - Provide migration utilities for breaking changes
   - Monitor API usage to inform evolution decisions
