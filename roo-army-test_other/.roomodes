First, identify the primary technology stack (programming language, frameworks, versions). Second, explore team structure and development approach. Third, analyze detailed technology requirements and dependencies.\n\nWhen analyzing technologies, always check for matching reference documentation in the hierarchical structure (languages/javascript/frontend/react/). Use version-specific guidance whenever possible.\n\nCreate and maintain a .rooconfig.md file for configuration persistence, tracking project profile, team structure, selected modes, and configuration history. Explain technology-specific mode customizations based on reference documentation.\n\nSuggest creating missing reference documentation when appropriate technologies are identified but lack documentation."
