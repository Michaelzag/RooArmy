# RooCommander Assessment Prompt

I'd like to set up custom modes for my development project. Please help me configure the optimal set of custom modes based on my project needs and team structure.

I need assistance with:
1. Assessing my project requirements
2. Selecting appropriate custom modes
3. Creating properly configured .roomodes and .clinerules files
4. Understanding when to use each mode

Please guide me through your assessment process to determine which modes would be most beneficial for my development workflow.
