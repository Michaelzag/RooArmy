# Revised RooCommander Approach

This document outlines a revised approach for the RooCommander workflow, incorporating the "What-How-What" structure and improved configuration management.

## Core Principles

1. **Technology-First Approach**: Identify the technical stack before defining team roles
2. **Adaptive Analysis**: Flexible package compatibility analysis without rigid enforcement
3. **Version-Specific Expertise**: Leverage reference docs for version-specific guidance
4. **Configuration Persistence**: Track user choices for revisiting and refinement
5. **Documentation Assistance**: Help users create reference docs when needed

## Revised User Flow

### Phase 1: Primary Technology Identification (First "What")
- Identify main programming language(s)
- Determine project type (web, mobile, API, etc.)
- Identify primary frameworks/platforms

### Phase 2: Team Structure & Development Approach ("How")
- Team size and composition
- Development methodology
- Specialized roles needed based on technology choices

### Phase 3: Detailed Technology Profile (Second "What")
- Package file analysis (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Version-specific features and constraints
- Reference documentation matching or creation

### Phase 4: Mode Recommendations & Configuration
- Select modes based on all gathered information
- Generate .roomodes file
- Create configuration persistence file
- Explain technology-specific mode customizations

## Configuration Persistence

A project-level file (e.g., `.rooconfig.md` or `.rooconfig.json`) would maintain:

```md
# RooCommander Configuration

## Project Profile
- **Main Language**: JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: React v18, Express v5
- **Project Type**: Web Application
- **Database**: MongoDB v7.0

## Team Structure
- **Size**: Small (2-5 people)
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate
- **Key Roles**: Frontend, Backend, DevOps

## Selected Modes
- commander (Configuration)
- react-v18 (Frontend)
- express-v5 (Backend)
- mongodb-v7.0 (Database)
- qa (Testing)

## Configuration History
- **Initial Setup**: 2024-05-01
- **Last Modified**: 2024-06-15 (Added MongoDB mode)
```

This file would be:
- Human-readable (using Markdown)
- Updatable by RooCommander during reconfiguration
- Versioned to track changes

## Reference Documentation Approach

Three-tier approach for technology reference:

1. **Existing Documentation**: Use available reference docs from the pool
2. **Assisted Creation**: Help users create new documentation with ask_perplexity
3. **Manual Template**: Provide a template for manual creation as fallback

## Mode Reconfiguration Scenarios

### Minor Changes
- Adding/removing individual modes
- Updating versions of existing technologies
- Quick configuration without full reassessment

### Major Changes
- Changing primary language or framework
- Significant project type changes
- Complete reassessment with context from previous configuration

## Package Analysis Strategy

Adaptive analysis that:
- Identifies key packages and their versions
- Warns about potential compatibility issues
- Supports unusual configurations when users confirm
- Builds technology profiles for mode customization

This approach allows for flexibility while providing robust guidance based on the project's specific technology choices.
