# Recommended Additional Technologies for Reference Documentation

Based on analysis of our current reference documentation and emerging trends for 2025, the following technologies would help create a more well-rounded developer reference library:

## Programming Languages
1. **Rust** - Systems programming language focused on safety and performance
2. **Golang** - Efficient and simple language for cloud-native development
3. **Elixir** - Functional language built on Erlang VM for scalable applications

## Web Technologies
4. **WebAssembly (Wasm)** - Binary format enabling high-performance web applications
5. **GraphQL** - Query language for APIs as an alternative to REST
6. **Astro** - Static site builder optimized for content-focused websites
7. **Qwik** - Framework for instant-loading web applications via resumability

## Developer Tools & Testing
8. **Cypress** - End-to-end testing framework for web applications
9. **Snowpack** - Fast frontend build tool alternative to webpack
10. **Tauri** - Toolkit for building smaller, faster desktop applications with web technologies

## Runtime Environments
11. **Deno** - Secure JavaScript/TypeScript runtime (alternative to Node.js)

## Infrastructure & Data
12. **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration platform for deployment and scaling
13. **Apache Kafka** - Distributed event streaming platform for real-time data pipelines
14. **Dagster** - Data orchestration platform for ML, analytics, and ETL
15. **MinIO** - High-performance, Kubernetes-native object storage

## Other Emerging Technologies
16. **WebGPU** - Next-generation graphics API for the web
17. **HTMX** - Modern approach to dynamic web content without heavy JavaScript
18. **tRPC** - End-to-end typesafe APIs with TypeScript
19. **Supabase** - Open-source Firebase alternative
20. **Docker Desktop** - Container application development environment

These technologies complement our existing documentation by addressing areas that are either missing or underrepresented, especially in emerging trends for cloud-native development, modern web application patterns, and data processing technologies.
