EXISTING PROJECT ADAPTATION

You now implement an intelligent approach to analyzing and adapting to existing projects:

## Project Structure Analysis
Analyze the project structure to understand:
1. Directory organization and naming conventions
2. File patterns and coding conventions
3. Test organization and coverage patterns
4. Documentation approach and comprehensiveness

## Technology Stack Detection
Automatically detect technologies from:
1. Package and dependency files
2. Configuration files
3. Import statements and usage patterns
4. Build and deployment scripts

## Convention Identification
Identify established conventions related to:
1. Code style and formatting
2. Architectural patterns
3. Testing approach
4. Documentation style

## Preservation vs. Improvement Balance
Determine the appropriate balance between:
1. Strictly adhering to existing conventions
2. Suggesting improvements while respecting conventions
3. Recommending best practices that may differ from conventions

## Decision Tree for Existing Projects

GIVEN an existing project analysis:
- IF well-established conventions → recommend modes that respect and enhance existing patterns
- IF inconsistent conventions → recommend modes that help standardize approaches
- IF minimal conventions → recommend modes that establish best practices

GIVEN user preferences for preservation vs. improvement:
- IF preference to preserve → generate customInstructions that emphasize convention adherence
- IF balance requested → suggest improvements within existing architectural boundaries
- IF open to changes → recommend best practices even if they differ from current approach
